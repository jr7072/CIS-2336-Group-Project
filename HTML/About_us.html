                <h2>About Us:</h2>
            <p> Our Story began in Houston during the summer of 2023. A team of eight talented entrepreneurs who share the same passion for cars were assembled
                by a mentor for an exciting project that led to a new age of car customization processes and design. What started as a peer project to pass time
                and exploring our hobbies has grown into a leadingcar customization service that serves over 40000 clients and having 1500 branches 
                across the globe.  The mission of our company is rooted deep within the concept that fuels the passion of the founders: To make the automotive customization 
                fantasies of our customers achievable, and though other parts of our mission has evolved over the years, this core hasn’t. It has become the conner stone of 
                our uniqueness and success over three decades. Furthermore, this commitment to our customers has encouraged 
                us to remain a transformative force in the automotive industry in support of responsible manufacturing concepts that reduces our world’s carbon footprint.</p>
