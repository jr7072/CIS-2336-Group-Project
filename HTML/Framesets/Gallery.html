With its shapely fenders and sprawling rear wing, the Huayra looks like it was built to conquer the racetrack. And much like a race car, it's constructed with an eye on minimizing curb weight. It's made from materials such as carbon-titanium HP62, a substance that's lighter and stronger than standard carbon fiber. The current Huayra is scheduled to be the last of the line. Still, that may change, since Pagani has a history of acquiescing to the requests of private collectors seeking a one-off or limited-edition model. With only 40 production models planned, the Huayra is rare and magnificent.

The Huayra's sole trim is the BC roadster, a convertible with enough fire and flash to stir the hearts of the brand's longtime devotees. The initials in this trim's moniker are a tribute to the late Benny Caiola, a car collector who holds the distinction of being Pagani's very first customer. Specially designed Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires wrap 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels in front and 21-inch rims in the rear. The Huayra BC comes standard with lower-body aero elements and a massive wing, and Pagani claims these features work hand in hand to produce a maximum of 1102 pounds of downforce at 174 mph. All models are equipped with a titanium exhaust that directs exhaust gases to the functional diffuser, much like the blown diffusers of Formula 1.

A twin-turbocharged V-12 lives in the middle of the car. Sourced from Mercedes-AMG, this engine generates 791 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque. A seven-speed single-clutch automatic sends power to the rear wheels. Pagani notes that this single-clutch setup is lighter than a dual-clutch transmission. Speaking of weight, the Huayra BC is relatively svelte, tipping the scales at about 2755 pounds. Given the engine's output, we weren't surprised when it leapt to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds at our test track. According to Pagani the roadster can generate up to 1.9 g's of continuous lateral acceleration when taken through a corner, with peaks of up to 2.2 g's. Carbon-ceramic Brembo brakes are on hand to quickly bring this hypercar to a standstill.
