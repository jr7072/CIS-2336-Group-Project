The early 2010s were a golden age for the hypercar as manufacturers of exotic automobiles began to explore the power potential of hybrid drivetrains. Although big cylinder counts and massive turbos were still on the menu, the addition of batteries and electric motors provided startling gains in acceleration and speed that had previously been next to impossible to achieve.

Combine all of the above with quantum leaps in the use of advanced materials like carbon fiber, alongside innovative manufacturing techniques that made ultra-slippery aerodynamic shapes possible, and the result was vehicles like the McLaren P1. Not only was it the first hybrid built by the British brand, it was also the first hybrid supercar on the market, period. On sale starting in 2013, the P1 drew from both McLaren's Formula One experience and its previous F1 supercar to create a truly special machine that's just as impressive today as it was when it first launched.

The P1 is a superhero among supercars: supermodel shapely, heroically powerful, stratospherically expensive, and—here's the one drawback—unavailable. That's because all 375 examples of the million-dollar plus, 903-hp gas/electric hybrid land rocket have been sold. The technology amazes: There's a 3.8-liter 727-hp V-8 paired with a 177-hp electric motor, hydro-pneumatic suspension, electro-hydraulically assisted steering, and even a rear wing that extends almost 12 inches. Ah, to be rich...
