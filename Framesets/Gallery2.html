Hybrid sports cars are increasingly common thanks to electricity's performance-enhancing qualities, but the 2020 BMW i8 is more about looking fast than going fast. Still, the BMW provides a show-stopping entrance regardless of whether its dihedral doors open on the hardtop coupe or convertible roadster. While its plug-in powertrain is respectably powerful—and quicker than lesser hybrids—you're more likely to see one tear around a Whole Foods parking lot than your local racetrack. A user-friendly ride and comfortable front seats make the 2020 i8 usable every day; however, its limited storage space and compromised cabin access might cross it off most people's list.

After earning a subtle makeover for 2019, which included updated battery technology and the addition of the convertible roadster, the 2020 i8 lineup carries over unchanged.We'd pony up the extra cash for the open-air driving experience that is only available with the 2020 i8 roadster. With standard all-wheel drive and only one powertrain, those decisions are already made for you. Every model has niceties such as leather upholstery, a head-up display, heated front seats, a Harman/Kardon sound system, and Apple CarPlay integration. However, we'd spice things up with the Tera World package that brings ceramic controls, black brake calipers, blue seatbelts, and an exclusive brown interior. Most exterior colors are no-cost options except for the Crystal White paint with blue or grey accents. Those looking to maximize the i8's wow factor should consider adding the adaptive LED headlights with what BMW calls Laserlight.

BMW offers a single powertrain in the i8. It mates a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder gas engine with an 11.6-kWh battery pack and two electric motors. The trio of power sources combines for a total of 369 horsepower, capable of driving all four wheels. However, it's not the fastest supercar on the block: The 2019 i8 roadster we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The i8 suffers from the same light steering that we've criticized in many current BMWs. We'd prefer more feedback, especially in a vehicle with sporting intentions. The ride is surprisingly civil and bumps in the road are felt, but never harshly.
